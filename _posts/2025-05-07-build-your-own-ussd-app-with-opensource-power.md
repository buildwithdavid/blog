Ever wondered how those *123# menus work on your phone?
What if you could actually build one yourself?

USSD technology (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) might seem old-school compared to mobile apps, but it remains crucial in regions where smartphone penetration and internet access are still growing — like Papua New Guinea and many other developing markets.
In fact, USSD often leapfrogs traditional infrastructure, delivering essential services to millions through the most basic mobile phones.

In this series of posts, I'll share my hands-on journey building a dynamic USSD application using readily available open-source tools.
Forget rigid, hardcoded menus — we'll focus on flexible, dynamic menu retrieval and session management, the kind of approach that’s scalable, adaptable, and practical for real-world telco environments.

Whether you're a developer curious about USSD, a telecom enthusiast, or someone looking for actionable implementation tips, you’ll find something valuable here. Follow along — and by the end of this series, you could be well on your way to building your own USSD-powered services!

Here's what you can expect in the series:

Part 1: What is USSD and Why It Matters Today

Part 2: Designing a Dynamic USSD Flow – Key Concepts

Part 3: Open Source Stack – Tools I'm Using (Python, Django, and more)

Part 4: Building the App – Session Handling, Menus, and API Integration

Part 5: Deploying, Testing, and Scaling for Production

Get ready to unlock the true power of simple technology — and to build something that can reach millions.
